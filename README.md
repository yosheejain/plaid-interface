The source code for the implementation of the PLAID interface accepted at CHI 2025. PLAID is a tool that assists instructors in identifying programming plans.

Preview PLAID at [http://tryplaid.web.illinois.edu](http://tryplaid.web.illinois.edu)!

To deploy locally, replace the `api_key`, `api_version`, and `azure_endpoint` in the `app/routes.py` file with your own.

Then, run the app with the command ```python app.py```.
